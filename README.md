# fish-weight-prediction
This is an example of models that I built on a fish dataset for weight prediction.

12/17/2022 - added newest version of notebook, will organize and finish it at a later date.

2/5/2023 - added newest version of notebook - had to redo a lot of it due to a technical issue.

In order to finish this project, I will only add the linear regression models and the randomforest. Considerations for future work will be in the conclusion statement of the notebook.
